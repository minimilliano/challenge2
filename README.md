## Overview

## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I was able to learn CSS responsiveness in  this project. Also, adding googlefonts without necessarily downloading it. I did this by adding the link to my head section in HTML file and naming the font family in my CSS stylesheet.
e.g
```html
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
```css
body{
	font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development
I will proceed learning in javascrript and frameworks to add functionality to my code in the future.

### Useful resources
- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This was very useful to me  for understanding HTML5 and CSS custom properties. I really l recommend to check out. It's beginner friendly.
